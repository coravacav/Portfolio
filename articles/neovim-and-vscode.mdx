# Neovim and VSCode

I used VSCode since roughly 2017.
It was a far cry from the traditional "IDE" I was used to before, and I found it really nice.
Mainly, the key things that I liked about it was it's ability to use multiline and multicursor far better than any editor I had used before it.

## Why Neovim?

After years of using it, I started to get annoyed with it. I only really had three key complaints.

-   It was slow to startup (especially with a lot of plugins)
-   I worked on a remote machine, and doing that with VSCode SSH (while great), was even slower to startup because you had to open VSCode first, then connect, then reopen it.
-   Managing files is a pain. There's no good way to "create file at path".

I had heard about Neovim, and I had heard that it was fast, and I had heard that it was good for remote development. Sounds perfect! So I gave it a go.

## What can anyone learn from this?

Ultimately, know your tools. If I had spent the same time configuring VSCode as I was forced to for Neovim, I probably would have been able to get it even more productive.
