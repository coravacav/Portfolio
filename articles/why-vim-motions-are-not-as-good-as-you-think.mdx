# Why vim motions are not as good as you think

Let's get this out of the way: They're awesome overall. This is not a testament to how bad they are, but rather the inadvertent consequences of their design.

## The pros

Let's start with the good stuff:

-   They're fast. You can move around your code with relative ease
-   They're easy to access. `hjkl` is a lot easier to access than `left, down, up, right`
-   They're expressive. Using text objects like `a{` or `iw` lets you select what you want, far faster.

I miss these every day I no longer use vim bindings, but, as you'll see, the cons outweigh the pros.
